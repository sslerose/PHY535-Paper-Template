% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
\normalsize
A research paper begins with a short abstract containing a summary of the aims, the methods, and the results of the investigation. Your paper’s abstract should therefore contain a clear statement of the overall nature of your project, and include a summary of how the work was done. You might write, for example: We have determined the elementary unit of electrical charge, e, by measuring the terminal speed of ten charged oil drops in a uniform electric field. An abstract should also contain your estimate of the true value of the measured quantity and its error – assuming you have only one or two such values to report. For example, you could write: We find the charge of the electron to be $\SI{-1.73(22)e-19}{\coulomb}$. Note that only 2 significant figures are given in the error, and the least significant digit (LSD) of the error corresponds to the LSD of the quoted mean value.
