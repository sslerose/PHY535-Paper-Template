\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}

The final section of the paper should summarize your findings and emphasize what has been learned as a result of your work. Compare the new results with what was already known, and discuss research which could lead to an improved future understanding.

The context for this part of the paper should be firmly rooted in the discussion which appeared in the Theory section. There you have presented the case for obtaining a new and improved measurement of a physical constant, or testing the prediction of a physical theory. This is true even for work which is done as a student laboratory assignment!

Typically, a paper's concluding section does not emphasize the experimental aspects of the investigation, but rather how the measured results have advanced our state of knowledge. This is not to say that experimental issues are excluded from the Conclusions, just that they are not usually given an emphasis unless the project is primarily focused on a novel or significantly improved experimental method.
